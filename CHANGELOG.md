# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Restored usage cards and cache telemetry with Reasonix 1.19+ by consuming its advertised namespaced ACP status snapshot and update methods, while retaining compatibility with legacy usage updates.

## 0.3.0

- Added a composer `+` menu with four actions: attach local files or images, reference workspace files or folders, reference past sessions, and insert slash commands. Attachments show as removable chips and are read at send time with size caps; images are sent as ACP `image` blocks when the backend supports them.
- Redesigned settings with a horizontal text tab bar, and turned the Behavior tab tool-approval entry into a functional Ask/Auto/Yolo segmented control backed by the ACP session config.
- New sessions now default the tool approval policy to `auto` when the backend advertises it; resumed sessions keep their previous policy.
- Fixed narrow-width composer clipping: removed the 300px page minimum, restored footer overflow scrolling, and kept popover menus anchored with `position: fixed`.
- Renamed the plan-mode composer chip to match the menu wording, and removed several generations of dead legacy CSS.

## 0.2.0

- Updated the extension to the Reasonix 1.0 `main-v2` ACP contract, including capabilities, config options, models, modes, dynamic commands, plans, tool locations, and native session lifecycle.
- Split composer execution, work profile, and tool approval controls into independent ACP-backed axes (`normal/plan/goal`, `economy/balanced/delivery`, and `ask/auto/yolo`).
- Added trusted-workspace filesystem overlay callbacks for unsaved reads and guarded writes, plus client-owned VS Code terminals with bounded output.
- Replaced prompt XML context with bounded ACP resource blocks and separated structured Ask questions from tool approvals.
- Added automatic reconnect/resume, native session listing/deletion, setup improvements, telemetry fallback behavior, and expanded unit/Extension Host/real-ACP/VSIX verification.

## 0.1.1

- Moved the Marketplace/Open VSX publishing namespace to `SivanLiu`.

## 0.1.0

- Refined the Reasonix chat UI with the compact Reasonix/Cline-inspired layout, bilingual interface controls, streamlined mode/model controls, and a dedicated settings entry.
- Added release automation for CI, VSIX packaging, content verification, Visual Studio Marketplace publishing, and Open VSX publishing.
- Added a formal Marketplace/Open VSX PNG icon and tightened the VSIX file allowlist.

## 0.0.1

- Added the initial Reasonix VS Code extension with ACP process hosting, chat UI, workspace sessions, editor context injection, cancellation, model picking, permission approvals, and diff previews.
- Added usage/cache telemetry, status bar reporting, inline approval cards, slash/skill/MCP surface chips, OutputChannel path redaction, and `@vscode/test-electron` fake-ACP smoke coverage.
